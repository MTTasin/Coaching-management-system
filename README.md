# Coaching Management System Web Application

This is a web application that allows coaching centers to manage their students, teachers, payments, and attendance. It is built with Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and Django.

***Point to be noted before you copy-paste all of it. I have removed my security key from the settings.py of the project. As it is an actual project that I have built for my client. So it will not run if you run directly. You have to generate a security key before you do so.***
